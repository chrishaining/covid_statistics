## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
temperatures <- c(16, 18, 15, 14, 15, 16, 19)
names(temperatures) <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")
temperatures
```
```{r}
plot(temperatures)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
scores <- c(98, 43, 84, 65, 72, 56)
students <- c("Jaz", "Sniper", "Cat", "Fascia", "Zendra", "Pantola")
names(scores) <- students
scores

totalScores <- sum(scores)
totalScores
meanScore <- mean(scores)
meanScore
maxScore <- max(scores)
maxScore
productOfScores <- prod(scores)
productOfScores

newScores <- c(99, 99, 98, 12, 45, 57)
names(newScores) <- c("Poo", 'Ka', 'Zigger', 'Eyesore', 'Mosli', 'Alaima')

scores > newScores
newScores == scores
topScores <- scores[c(1,3,5)]
topScores
sorted <- sort(newScores)
bottomScores <- sorted[c(1:3)]
bottomScores
worst <- bottomScores['Eyesore']
worst
passers <- scores[scores>50] 
passers
#plot(scores)

```
