# Covid-19 stats

This **R** project has two main purposes:
1. Just to practise my use of R and RStudio
2. To analyse some data relating to the Covid-19 virus.

This is not intended as a finished, polished project. By its nature it's scrappy, and is for my own personal use. 

I have included explanations in the `.Rmd` files, so I won't provide further explanation in this README.
