another attempt to predict growth rates.
* assumes deaths double every 4 days, so I will use rate of 1.25 per day
* rather than use a single date to extrapolate predictions, this predictor calculates each new daily prediction from the previous day.

## Predicted Deaths Using Two Growth Rates
Predicted Deaths (25%) predicts what would happen if the rate of growth was 25% a day. That is, it would take about 4 days for the number of deaths to double.

Predicted Deaths (50%) predicts what would happen if the rate of growth was 50% a day. That is, it would take about 2 days for the number of deaths to double.

Actual Deaths: this is the number confirmed by the World Health Organization, based on the number of deaths registered up to and including the relevant date.

Note that the number of deaths registered on a given date may not accurately reflect the number who died. There could be backlogs in the registration system. However, I am assuming that this inaccuracy evens out in the long run.  
```{r}
#add data to actual deaths
predictions <- predictions %>% mutate('Actual Deaths'=replace(as.numeric('Actual Deaths'), date==c("2020-03-27", "2020-03-28", "2020-03-29", "2020-03-30", "2020-03-31", "2020-04-01", "2020-04-02", "2020-04-03", "2020-04-04", "2020-04-05", "2020-04-06", "2020-04-07", "2020-04-08", "2020-04-09", "2020-04-10", "2020-04-11","2020-04-12", "2020-04-13"), c(578, 759, 1019, 1228, 1408, 1789, 2532, 2921, 3606, 4303, 4934, 5373, 6159, 7097,7978,8958,9875,10612)))

Note that the figures here may seem to be a day or two behind the figures in the media. This is because the figures in the table are based on the WHO's situation reports, which are produced the day after the UK announces its figures. For instance, where I give predictions for 2020-03-31 of 1413-1695.6, the UK government announced the relevant figure on 2020-03-30. Even these figures are delayed: the figure that the UK announced on 2020-03-30 reflected the situation at 0900 on 2020-03-29. It may also be that the WHO are using slightly different figures from the UK government (possibly due to a different methodology). However, the numbers are similar enough for my purposes.

Also check out predictions from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. They estimate that UK deaths will be in the range 55-79.9K. They also give the number of ICU beds available to Covid-19 patients as only 799, which seems really low compared to what the UK government says (they're talking 10K-18K). Has someone made an error, or is this the difference between total ICU beds and ICU beds available to Covid patients?
